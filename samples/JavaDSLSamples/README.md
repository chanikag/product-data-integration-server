#Java DSL (Internal DSL) Samples

There are two types of Java DSLs available (still WIP). We have a sample for each of these types.
Samples are available at samples/JavaDSLSamples directory.

A sample can be built using maven and the outcome is an osgi bundle which need to be deployed to 
 <CARBON_HOME>/osgi/dropins directory
